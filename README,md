# Basic Metabot
A very simple example to show how to build a Metabot that integrates with Automation Anywhere Enterprise Client (v10).

Compiled in Visual Studio 2017.

This example exposes two methods:
- HelloName, which returns "Hello $inputName$", and
- AddTwo, which adds 2 to the variable passed in
